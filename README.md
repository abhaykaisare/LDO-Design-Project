## Overview
This project focuses on the design of a **CMOS Low Dropout (LDO) Regulator** in **180nm technology**.  
The objective is to regulate the input supply of **1.8 V** to a stable output of **1.5 V**, with a dropout voltage of **0.3 V** and load current up to **100 mA**.

The design targets:
- **High PSRR** across frequency
- **Fast transient response** for sudden load changes
- **Stable operation** across process corners and temperature variations

## Design and Implementation

### 1. Bandgap Reference (BGR)
- Provides a **temperature-independent reference voltage** for vref.
- Implemented using **PTAT + CTAT combination**.
- Implemented **Current Mode** BGR for generating constant 0.9V.

### 2. Folded Cascode Error Amplifier
- Chose **PMOS Input** Folded cascode architecture for better noise suppression.
- Chosen for **high DC gain** and **wide output swing**.
- Folded cascode has only one dominant pole hence best suited for this application.

### 3. Pass Device
- Implemented using a PMOS transistor as the series pass element for low dropout voltage.
- Size chosen to minimize **Rds(on)** and **keep the device in saturation**.

---

### 4. Feedback Network
- **Resistive divider** used to scale down Vout.
- Divider ratio selected to set Vout = 1.5 V.

## Simulation Results

### BGR Output Characteristics

### STB Analysis (Loop Gain & PSRR)
- Loop gain simulated to verify **gain > 60 dB** and **phase margin > 60¬∞**.
- PSRR simulated at multiple frequencies to ensure supply noise rejection.

### Line & Load Regulation
- **Line Regulation:** Swept input voltage from 1.0 V to 3.0 V and observed Vout variation.
- **Load Regulation:** Swept load current from no-load to full-load and observed output voltage droop.

### PVT Analysis
To ensure robust operation across all process, voltage, and temperature corners, a comprehensive **PVT analysis** was performed.

- **Process Corners:** Simulated across TT, FF, SS, SF, FS process corners.
- **Temperature Range:** Simulated from **-40¬∞C to 125¬∞C**.

#### Key Observations:
- **Loop Gain & Phase Margin:** Remained >60¬∞ across all PVT corners ensuring stability.
- **PSRR:** Maintained >50 dB up to 1 kHz even in worst-case corner.
- **Line Regulation:** Output variation was within ¬±2% across voltage corners.
